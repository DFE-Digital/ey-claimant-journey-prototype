      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">
        How it works
      </h1>
      
      <p>To receive the payment, you must have applied for a job that offers a £1,000 payment.</p>
      <p>After you’ve been offered and accepted the job, your nursery will start a claim for the payment on your behalf.</p>
      <p>After the nursery has started the claim, you’ll receive an email inviting you to complete the claim on a digital service. To do this, we’ll help you create a GOV.UK One Login account if you do not already have one. This is so that we can verify your identity.</p>
      <p>When we have verified your identity, we’ll ask you for a few details including your bank account details.</p>
      <p>You’ll receive the incentive payment after you’ve been in the role for 6 months.</p>

      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">
        Eligibility
      </h1>

      <p class="govuk-body">You’re eligible for a payment if:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>you have applied for a job with an incentive attached</li>
      <li>you have not worked in a permanent role in an early years setting in the 6 months before starting your new role, where you spent most of your time (70% or more) working directly with children</li>
      <li>the role you’ve applied for is a permanent contract (this applies to part and full-time roles)</li>
      <li>you’ll spend most of the time (70% or more) in your role working directly with children</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You do not need to have any early years qualifications or have worked in a nursery before.</p>
      <p>You cannot receive the incentive payment if you:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>have worked in a permanent role in a nursery in the last 6 months</li>
      <li>will not be spending most of your time (70% or more) working directly with children in your new role</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">
        Apprenticeships
      </h1>

      <p>Incentive payments are not available to apprentices, even if you have a permanent contract during your apprenticeship.</p>
      <p>You can receive a payment when you move from being an apprentice to an employee. To do this, you must have passed your apprenticeship and been taken on in a permanent role.</p>
      
        <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">
        How you're paid
      </h1>
      
      <p>The Department for Education will pay the money directly into your bank account. This will happen after you have been in the role for 6 months.</p>

      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">
        Tax and deductions
      </h1>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Income tax
      </h2>

      <p>The Department for Education will pay Income Tax and National Insurance on your payment if your total annual income is less than £50,270.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Universal Credit
      </h2>

      <p>If you claim Universal Credit, your £1,000 payment may affect the amount of Universal Credit you receive.</p>
      <p>Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/universal-credit-and-earnings">how changes to your earnings can affect your Universal Credit.</a></p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Student loan
      </h2>

      <p>Your £1,000 payment will not be affected by any funding you have previously received to study for a college course or apprenticeship.</p>
      <p>If you have previously studied at university and have a student loan, your £1,000 payment may affect your repayments.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        If you're currently repaying a student loan
      </h2>

      <p>If your payslip shows that you’re repaying a student loan, a deduction towards it may come out of your £1,000 payment.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        If you have a student loan but are not currently repaying it
      </h2>

      <p>If your payment takes you over the amount you must earn to start paying back a student loan, a deduction may go towards repaying it.</p>
      <p>Read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan/when-you-start-repaying">when you start paying back a student loan</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan/what-you-pay">what you'll pay.</a></p>
      <p>You may be able to claim any deductions back at the end of the tax year. Read more about how you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan/getting-a-refund">claim back student loan deductions.</a></p>

      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">
        If you leave before you’ve been in the role for 6 months
      </h1>

      <p>You must have stayed in your role for at least 6 months to receive the payment.</p>
